    *   **Identity**: Microsoft Azure is the **second-largest cloud platform** and is considered AWS's chief rival. It is an offering of Microsoft.
    *   **Background**: Azure was established in 2010 to provide enterprises with a capable platform, later renamed 'Microsoft Azure' in 2014.
    *   **Scale**: As of September 2021, Azure ran 64 regions with 15 under construction, maintaining 126 availability zones with 37 more being built. It maintained 192 edge locations globally, with 4 in the US government cloud. It offers over 200 products and services.
    *   **Characteristics**: Azure is particularly tailored to support Microsoft-centric enterprises, making cloud migration easier for these organizations. More than 95% of Fortune 500 companies use Microsoft Azure today. It is not limited to Windows-based services and supports open-source languages, technologies, and platforms. Azure has an impressive set of over 200 artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and analytics services. It offers great support for hybrid cloud strategies. Consensus suggests Azure currently has the **lowest on-demand pricing**, and enterprise customers already using Microsoft services benefit from lower costs.
    *   **Considerations**: Azure has fewer service offerings compared to AWS and is particularly geared towards enterprise customers. Azure's largest instance is reportedly the most expensive per hour compared to AWS and GCP.

3.  **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
    *   **Identity**: Compared to AWS and Azure, GCP is the **smallest of the big three cloud providers**. It is a suite of cloud computing services by Google.
    *   **Background**: GCP was established in 2008, originally as App Engine. It has established a strong foothold in the cloud business in less than a decade, strengthening Google's products like search and YouTube.
    *   **Scale**: As of September 2021, GCP had 40 cloud regions with eight new ones coming soon, 121 zones, and 187 edge locations. It currently offers over 200 services spanning computing, networking, big data, and more.
    *   **Characteristics**: GCP is the **fastest-growing** of the big three. It offers high-end big data analytics solutions, machine learning and artificial intelligence tools, and easy interaction with containers and Kubernetes. It plays nicely with other Google services and products. GCP has excellent support for containerized workloads and utilizes Google's global fiber network. It provides IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS globally. It is primarily a service for developing and maintaining original applications from its hyper-scale data centers.
